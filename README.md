# Balmy Oracles

This repository will hold all Balmy's oracle infrastructure. It aims to have a sufficiently flexible architecture as to support a wide amount of tokens composition, and therefore enabling quoting pairs that couldn't be done before.

Some of this is achieved by leveraging already existing oracles like [Uniswap V3 Static Oracle](https://github.com/Balmy-Protocol/uniswap-v3-oracle).

## ðŸ”’ Audits

Oracles has been audited by [Omniscia](https://omniscia.io/) and can be find [here](https://omniscia.io/reports/mean-finance-oracle-module/).

## ðŸ“¦ NPM/YARN Package

The package will contain:

- Artifacts can be found under `@balmy/oracles/artifacts`
- Typescript smart contract typings under `@balmy/oracles/typechained`

## ðŸ“š Documentation

Everything that you need to know as a developer on how to use all repository smart contracts can be found in the [documented interfaces](./solidity/interfaces/).

## ðŸ›  Installation

#### YARN

```sh
yarn add @balmy/oracles
```

### NPM
